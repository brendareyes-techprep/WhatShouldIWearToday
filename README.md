This is my code for my final project. 
Welcome to UPick.
This is going to be your personal online closet. When you're getting up in the morning whether it's getting ready for work or a special event, you will no longer have to go through every single outfit option. No longer will you have to get home after an event, and get home to your house turned upside down. Now, you will just log and create outfits from the palm of your hand.
Log your outfits, your options and pick and choose while taking the train, walking home, even at the gym. 

How? 
Easy, first create your account. Once done, everything is up to you. First log in your items, hat, shoes, pants, coats, shirts. Once everything is logged in, you can slide over to the outfits sections where all your items will be at your disposal. Click and chose what you want to put into an outfit. 
How to take full advantage?
Details absolutely everything about the iteam, choose its hex color, put in details like this shirt fits a little snug. This way when you create your outfit these details don't get lost. 

Above all, be creative. 
More updates coming soon.
